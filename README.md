## VEDAS-Driven Autonomous Generation of Suricata Rules for CVEs

### Purpose
This repository serves as an open, collaborative validation space for Suricata rules generated autonomously by **ARPSyndicate's Vulnerability & Exploit Data Aggregation System (VEDAS)**. 

While such AI enables **rapid, large-scale creation of detection rules** from vulnerability and exploit intelligence, reliable security detection requires **transparency, human review, and real-world testing**. 

By making these AI-generated rules openly available, we hope to enable the security community to **review, validate, and improve detection logic through issues and pull requests**.

The goal is to bridge AI-driven automation with open-source collaboration to improve reliability and accelerate intelligence-driven detection engineering for all.

### Total Rules: 2059

| 2024 (253) | 2025 (143) | 2026 (0) |


### Disclaimer
Suricata rules in this repository are generated fully autonomously by the VEDAS platform and have undergone syntactic validation only. **Logical testing has not been performed in most cases. Please validate all rules prior to deployment.** Community feedback via pull requests and issues is encouraged.
